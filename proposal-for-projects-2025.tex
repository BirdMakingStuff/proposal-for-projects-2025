Welcome to the University of Auckland Linux User Group!  This year marks the first full year for the club!  The current and prospective executive committee members have recently met and we are excited to announce a barrage of projects that the club could end up taking for the rest of the year!  Some of these projects are designed to take place during the semesters, while others during the breaks.

In this document, we outline the following projects that we are planning to put up for vote.  As an aside, you are welcome to put forth projects that you think can be done with the help of club members, including personal pet projects as well as projects that will benefit the wider Linux community around the world.
