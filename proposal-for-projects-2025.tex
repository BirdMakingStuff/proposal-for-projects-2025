\newpage

Welcome to the University of Auckland Linux User Group!  This year marks the first full year for the club!  The current and prospective executive committee members have recently met and we are excited to announce a barrage of projects that the club could end up taking for the rest of the year!  Some of these projects are designed to take place during the semesters, while others during the breaks.

In this document, we outline the following projects that we are planning to put up for vote.  As an aside, you are welcome to put forth projects that you think can be done with the help of club members, including personal pet projects as well as projects that will benefit the wider Linux community around the world.

\section{Dev Projects}

\subsection{Free and Open-Source Admin Discord Bot}

This is a Discord bot that aims to be a free/libre and open-source replacement of popular server management bots like Carl.bot and MEE6.  The project aims to be modular, with the core including a plugin manager that allows various capabilities to be added or removed on-demand by users.

A team of four to six people is desired.

\subsubsection*{Skills Desired}

The tech stack is still up for debate, particularly between a Python-based library (e.g. \texttt{discord.py}, Pycord) and JavaScript/TypeScript (e.g. Discord.js).  The following skills are desired, but not required:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python and PyPI (discord.py, Pycord)
    \item or Node.js and JavaScript/TypeScript (Discord.js)
    \item HTTP REST API
    \item Functional Programming
    \item WebSockets
    \item Git and GitHub
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsubsection*{Time Commitment}

Each person is expected to contribute about 40 to 60 hours in total, or roughly 5 hours per week for a duration of 10 weeks.

There will be a weekly standup that is expected to take between 30 minutes and 1 hour per session.

\subsubsection*{Key Benefits}

In undertaking this exercise, you can expect to gain the following benefits

\begin{itemize}
    \item Improved skills and knowledge in software architecture, event-driven programming, software testing and networking
    \item Improved communication skills
    \item A free/libre and open-source server management bot that you can use for your own servers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Chat Frontend using Native Toolkits for Ollama}

This aims to provide a native chatbot frontend to Ollama and other popular LLM providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic.  There are many existing projects in the market (e.g. Open WebUI) that provide a user interface to LLM servers.  However, these projects tend to require a lot of dependencies such as Docker which may not be suitable for running on low-resource terminals like the Raspberry Pi and older computers.  The plan is to provide a free/libre and open-source alternative to Open WebUI that runs natively on key Linux distros, regardless of desktop environment or window manager.  The frontend must run on X11 and ideally on Wayland as well.

A team of four to six people is desired.

\subsubsection*{Skills Desired}

The tech stack is still up for debate, particularly between Qt, PyQt, PySide, Gtk, Kivy, wxWidgets, wxPython, JavaFX, Java Swing and Neutralinojs.  The following skills are desired, but not required:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python (PyQt, PySide, Kivy, wxPython)
    \item or JavaScript/TypeScript (Neutralinojs)
    \item or Java (JavaFX, JavaSwing)
    \item or C (Gtk)
    \item or C++ (Qt, wxWidgets)
    \item HTTP REST API
    \item SQLite
    \item Model-View-Controller
    \item Object-Oriented Programming
    \item Asynchronous Programming
    \item Git and GitHub
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsubsection*{Time Commitment}

Each person is expected to contribute about 50 to 70 hours in total, or roughly 6 hours per week for a duration of 10 weeks.

There will be a weekly standup that is expected to take between 30 minutes and 1 hour per session.

\newpage

\subsubsection*{Key Benefits}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Improved skills and knowledge in software architecture, event-driven programming and software testing
    \item Improved fundamental understanding of LLMs (e.g. parameter sizes, quantisation levels, etc)
    \item Improved communication skills
    \item A free/libre and open-source lightweight frontend for interfacing with an Ollama server
\end{itemize}
