\subsection{lwn.net Subscriber Bot}

The lwn.net is a long-standing source with weekly newsletters summarizing the latest Linux developments. We have several members who wish they had access occasionally, but not frequently enough to justify a personal subscription. This Discord bot will forward lwn's update summaries to a LUG newsfeed channel, then coordinate loaning articles via a subscriber link should a member be interested in reading a few selected articles.

\subsubsection*{Skills Desired}

git, a high-level programming language, and curiosity to play with third-party libraries.

\subsubsection*{Time Commitment}

Flexible. A few weekends should be enough for a Minimally Viable Product, and more features can be proposed if the developers are interested.

\subsubsection*{Key Benefits}

This project provides hands-on experience in data processing, including crawling web content, normalizing format/schema, and integration with Discord bot API. The outcome will be hosted as a part of the LUG's community infrastructure, where you can plant an easter egg of your choice within reason. You also get to know your users in the club :->
