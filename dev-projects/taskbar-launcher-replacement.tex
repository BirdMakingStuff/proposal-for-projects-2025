\subsection{Taskbar/Launcher Replacement}
Replacement for polybar (and potentially rofi/dmenu), attempting to eliminate bugs especially with the tray module. It should provide a modular way to enable/disable modules that provide different pieces of information.

\subsubsection*{Skills Desired}
\begin{itemize}
\item Language - probably C++ (or rust if necessary)
\item xlib/xcb or Wayland
\item Knowledge of linux utilities, and how to read documentation for libraries / APIs
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Time Commitment}

TODO: State the time commitment required from the student.  Include estimated total number of person-hours to completion, any scheduled meeting requirement, whether most of the time will be done during the semester or during the breaks, the flexibility of meetings, etc.

Variable, up to each student.

\subsubsection*{Key Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn a lot about linux, as most modules interact with other linux APIs, e.g. pulsaudio, alsa, brightnessctl, upower...
\item Learn about X / Wayland windows and window properties
\end{itemize}
